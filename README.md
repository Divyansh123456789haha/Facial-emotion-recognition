HI this is a working model of code of Facial emotion recognition 
First we have to download the dataset 
about the dataset used it is a 2013 dataset including grayscaled images which is ideal for Facial emotion recognition.
Secondly after the dataset is downloaded we will train our model
and also have to import a number of files
keras
cv2
numpy
now since the model is trained already we will apply the main code which will call the
webcam and use the model at the same time and thus the whole project would be working
note- download all files and put your saved file location
